Ghanshyam Prashant Waindeshkar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in ECO will be joining Navi as Product Analyst. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Associate Consultant – Bain &amp; Company
Business Analyst – Mckinsey &amp; Company

## Insights on the Selection Process
The interview process for Navi was pretty straight forward. They released an interview
shortlist based on the resumes (for other profiles they conducted tests) and then there were
three rounds of interviews. Despite interviewing a lot of candidates, the company offered job
to only two candidates so, the number of candidates that were able to convert the interview
into an offer were very low, and this was same for all the profiles for which the company came
to hire. If I can recall correctly around 35-50 students interviewed for the product profile and
only two of them received the offer, the company gave a total of seven offers across all the
profile.
From what I could make-up they had a very high expectations from the candidates, they were
looking for someone who had a really strong profile and also the required fundamentals for
the job.

##  Preparation Resources

solving.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1. Strong Profile: Talk to as much seniors as possible, try to understand what the
companies that you are targeting are looking for in the candidates and ideally your
resume should check all those boxes. (Like in case of consulting and product
companies look for candidates with good academic records, internships, extra-
curricular achievements, Position of responsibility etc.).
2. Resume: Making resume is an iterative process and you should never stop working
on it till the date of submission comes. Resumes are what you can consider your first
impression in front of the recruiters, so its only fair that you invest a decent amount of
time on it.
Identify seniors and alums that are working in the companies that you are targeting
and try to get multiple reviews from them. A good way to do this is uploading multiple
copies of a single draft of resume on google drive and sending each copy to a
particular senior and they can give you specific review by using the comment features.
3. Interview preparation: After securing an interview, everything boils down to two
things (i) Your preparations and (ii) Communication Skills.
For product and consulting related profiles you should try to form two case prep
groups of three member each. One should have students who you think are starting
with the same level of preparation as you and in the another you should practice with
student who are a little ahead in the preparations. There are endless resources
available online so I won’t go into what exactly you should prepare.
