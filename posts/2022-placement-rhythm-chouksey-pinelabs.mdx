## Insights on the Selection Process
The interview experience was very good. It consisted of 3 rounds. First two were technical
and the third was HR. In the first round 2 coding in which we have to explain the algorithm and
write the pseudo code. Questions from object oriented programing were also asked. The
second round was much detailed and had only one question the interviewer was itself an alum
of IITK and also asked some questions related to logic behind the algorithm and then asked to
reduce the time complexity of the code. Last round I was asked about what do I know about
Pine Labs. What does the company do. my internship experience and why I want to join pine

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Try to solve as much problems as possible do not leave any concepts and also make a habit
of thinking in steps so that in the interview you can explain your thought process behind your
code sometime the interviewer wants to understand the intuition behind you code and also
explain any other method if you know that the question can be solved with. Work on your
English skills and do some research about the company which you are selected for before
going for the interview also try to make a goal of solving a fixed number of question each day
as you have to manage your acads with your placement preparations
