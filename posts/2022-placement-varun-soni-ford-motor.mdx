aptitude and reasoning.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Don’ts:
Don’t push yourself to answer questions you have no idea about. There were advanced stats
questions which aren’t a part of MSO201A (probably the highest level of prob-stats many of
us study)
Dos:
Keep an eye on time allotted for each section and/or the entire paper. You might at time run
out of time if you’re not fast enough.
Revise your resume before interview based on what role the interview is for. This is when
you’re sitting for multiple roles.
