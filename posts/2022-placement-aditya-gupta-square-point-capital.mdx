Aditya Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CE will be joining Square Point Capital as Software Developer . Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
- Sprinklr
- Saplabs
- Cisco
- Finmechanics

## Insights on the Selection Process
- Interviews are more of a discussion rather than a question-answering session. The interviews
will indeed be stressful try to take small breaks if you want and most interviewers are chill
about it.
- Prioritize your companies accordingly – Don’t just sort the companies in decreasing order of
pay.

##  Preparation Resources
- LEETCODE
- INTERVIEWBIT
- GEEKSFORGEEKS
- Online notes for OS, DBMS, OOPS

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
- Start early – By starting early you will have enough time to prepare properly and you
will be able to cover the topics on time.
- Try before giving up on any skill – I know many people are just giving up on coding, I
would suggest trying it, giving it a month or so, and even then, if it’s not working for
you and then you can move on to any other skillset.
