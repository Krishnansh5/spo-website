Ananya Singh, studying in IIT Kanpur as a DUAL student in BT-CHE, DUAL-CHE will be joining Groww as Business Associate. Here are some brief insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
- Sprinklr (APM) 
- Navi
- Apollo 247 
- Jodo (Product Analyst)
- Barclays (Quant)

## Insights on the Selection Process
- For our year, the first round was supposed to be a deck submission and there was no shortlisting prior to that. Groww provided us with prompts for both APM and BA roles with a little more than a week’s time for submission. We could apply for one of the two profiles and submit our deck for the same.
- After that, they took out a shortlist based on the deck submissions. We were provided with a buddy who helped us prepare for what might be asked in the interview. This was supposed to be a non-evaluative interaction.
- This was followed by three rounds of interviews which mostly included questions from resume, case study, guesstimates and general HR.

##  Preparation Resources
- For sample interview questions, refer to the following placement prep material:

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
- I would just say that the whole process will feel very random many times and it’ll be difficult,
but always believe in yourself and keep working. 
- It helps big time to have a good support
system around you!
