and DP.
Third Round- Puzzles and concepts of probability and statistics. Projects from resumes were
also discussed.
Fourth Round- HR round.

##  Preparation Resources
For the Coding part
I did leetcode and interviewbit.
- Some standard data structures and algorithms are like the vocabulary of English. You
have to know some of them to be able to write code. So start with some standard
algorithms. You can refer to some youtube channels like codencode for graphs, aditya
verma for DP, and recursion.

- Don’t worry if you are not able to solve everything by yourself from the start. Try to
identify the patterns. For this, a very good resource is leetcode study
plans(https://leetcode.com/study-plan/). Questions are grouped according to the
similarity of concepts. Even if some of the study plans are paid, you can look for the
questions on GitHub.
- Give regular contests on any of the coding sites. I used leetcode for this. This will help
you to apply what you have learned and will improve your speed too.
For puzzles and probability part:
- Revise MSO201 or any other probability course from your department.
- Do puzzles from the book Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews By
Xinfeng Zhou. You can easily find the pdf.
- Brainstellar puzzles.
- 50 challenging problems in probability

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Start early and try to solve some questions every day. There is a daily question feature
on leetcode and gfg.
- Mark the questions and concepts on which you struggled. I made an Excel sheet for
this. Revise them after some days or before a test/interview.
- Shortlist 2-3 profiles and prepare for them only. Don’t run after every company and
profile.
- Make a small group of people to prepare with. Preparing in a group is always better as
you can discuss doubts. Healthy competition always encourages you to perform
better.
- Don’t hesitate to contact seniors. It does not matter whether you know that senior or
not. Just text them with your doubts. You can contact me also.
