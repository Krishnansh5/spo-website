Mukund Soni , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT-ME  student in MSE  will be joining Fourth-Frontier Technologies as Full-stack developer. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
JPMC
Barclays
Apollo24x7
Urban Health
Shipsy
Javis

## Insights on the Selection Process
The interview was directly an HR round, because the resume shortlist was highly based on

technical skills, key projects and experiences based on the profile we applied (in my case Full-
stack developer). Then the technical test was also based on Full-stack development, it

consists of two question on backend (we had to write some code to receive some data from
their database, and the other I don’t remember), two questions on frontend (we had to
develop a phonebook, and a button which toggles on click), and one coding question (coding
question level was Leetcode easy).
The interview round was mainly to check our communication skills, how we are thinking at the
moment, and our confidence. It lasted around 30-40 minutes.

##  Preparation Resources
For coding, first I read the topics from gfg and practice some basic questions on the topic from
there (Basic and Intermediate). Then I solved the Interview bit for further practice, as it covers
questions asked in interviews. And finally, I solved problems on Leetcode for more practice on
some difficult questions for technical test.
For preparations of HR round, we can find some standard questions on gfg and also their
answers. But according to me we should not give the same answers as found from sources, it
should be purely based on our thoughts, we can just use the resources to know what
questions are being asked.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
For preparing the technical test, it is of utmost importance that we give coding contests
regularly. We can find weekly and bi-weekly contests on Leetcode, interviewbit, codechef and
codeforces. But majority of the tests in placements, which I gave, were based on the pattern
of leetcode coding contest, so we should not miss them, and should solve them regularly on
first priority.
