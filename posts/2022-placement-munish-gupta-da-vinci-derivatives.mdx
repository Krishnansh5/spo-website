Munish Gupta , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT  student in MTH  will be joining Da Vinci Derivatives. as Quantitative Researcher. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Worldquant(Quant Researcher), Quantbox (Quant
Researcher and Developer), Squarepoint(Developer), JPMC(Software), Kivi Capital(Quant),
Morgan Stanley(Quant) on Day 1.

## Insights on the Selection Process
A representative from HR and from the technical team was present on the virtual call (Zoom).
Once they give you a technical question, you are given 30 seconds to a minute to come up
with the solution or your approach. They ask you to think aloud to get to know the thought
process. The Interview also involved standard HR questions, Why quant, why Da Vinci, etc.
Another HR question was to describe a project that inspired you the most and the conditions
you overcame. There was only one round and lasted around 45 mins.

##  Preparation Resources
For Quants - 50 Challenging problems in Probability, Cut the knot: Probability Riddles,
brainstellar.com, A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews by Xinfeng Zhou and
MSO201 slides.
For Coding - leetcode, InterviewBit and CodingNinjas. Try to cover the breadth first.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Placement shortlists do involve a bit of luck, so don’t be disheartened if you are not initially
shortlisted. Try to do previous year or company-specific questions as they are sometimes
repeated. In hindsight, I’d suggest starting the prep as early as possible. Even if you are
targeting other profiles, try to do a bit of coding. Lastly, a good group while preparing will
definitely help.
