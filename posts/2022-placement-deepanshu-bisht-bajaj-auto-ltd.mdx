Deepanshu Bisht, studying in IIT Kanpur as a MS(R) student in ME will be joining Bajaj Auto Ltd. as PGET. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
- Quest global (Sr. Engineer)

## Insights on the Selection Process
- Online test, 58 students from all streams selected for an interview
- Technical interview 
- HR Interview
- Interview round will consist of a Technical round followed by an HR round. The technical round will have 4 panels. Some panels were specifically for the operations dept, while some were for R&D. So it depends on your luck which panel you get, so prepare for both.

##  Preparation Resources
- If you have your GATE syllabus basics strong and little advanced knowledge it's good enough.
- It is important to give practical answers, to-the-point answers.
- Also went through some introductory videos from NPTEL on electric vehicles as they were also hiring for the Chetak division this year.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
- Be practical, precise in your answers. 
- Must go through the company website thoroughly. See what they are looking for that particular year. 
- Some focus on EV is good.
