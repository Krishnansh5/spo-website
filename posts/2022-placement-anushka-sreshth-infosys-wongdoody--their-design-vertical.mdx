Anushka Sreshth, studying in IIT Kanpur as a DUAL student in BT - ME, DUAL - M.DES will be joining Infosys (Wongdoody – their design vertical) as Lead Experience Designer. Here are some brief insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
- Jio (Visual Design Profile)
- TCS (UI Design)

## Insights on the Selection Process
- For Infosys, first, we had to fill out an application form and submit it along with our resumes, followed by a 24-hour design challenge which they used to shortlist the candidates and finally an interview.
- There was just one interview for Infosys, where after some introduction, they asked me to mainly walk through my portfolio projects, where they asked at some places to defend my
design decisions or like what all insights I got through the projects. After that, they asked me to go through the design challenge given by Infosys in a similar manner. The interview lasted about an hour, and that’s it.

##  Preparation Resources
- Online Articles on the different aspects of UX and UI design.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
- Select a good problem statement, first of all, to work on, and make sure every design decision you make has a justification behind it and nothing is just random.
- Try to make the visual
design good and for the design challenges, try to spend good enough time in designing the hi-
fi prototypes instead of getting too stuck in the minute details of the rest of the process. The
the process is important and should be focused on but do not compromise on the final
deliverables because of that.
- Basically, manage time well in such design challenges. 
- Try to submit interactive prototypes.
