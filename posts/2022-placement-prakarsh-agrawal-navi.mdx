Prakarsh Agrawal, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CE will be joining Navi as  Data Science. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
I was also shortlisted for the data science profile in sprinklr in the same slot as Navi. In SDE
profile, I was shortlisted in Edgeverve, Trellix. There were some more companies in which I
was shortlisted for analyst profile.

## Insights on the Selection Process
nan

##  Preparation Resources
At first, there was a technical test which included some aptitude and coding questions. Then,
there was resume shortlisting which was followed by 2 rounds of technical interview.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
I used leetcode to practice coding. Also, I practiced interviewbit programming questions.
For SQL, I used datalemur(https://datalemur.com/) basic version. It contains some very good
interview questions. Practicing these questions for SQL would be enough I guess. Try to learn
from the solution given. You can read the DBMS theory part from youtube or geeksforgeeks
or resources section of interviewbit.
For probability, I used brainstellar and 50 challenging problems book.
For machine learning and related topics, I read from geeksforgeeks and towardsdatascience

articles.
Also, I found resources section of interviewbit very helpful. It contains topicwise notes and
interview questions.
