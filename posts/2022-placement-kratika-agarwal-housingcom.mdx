## Insights on the Selection Process
First round was product centric. I was asked about my favourite product and then the
interviewer started grilling upon that same product by asking questions like what new feature
can you think which can be added to this product and started asking some technical questions
regarding the same .Also some philosophical kind of about your journey and how you take
your life as were asked. First round was common to all the profiles. Second round was the
growth round where I was asked questions about my growth intern and then the interviewer
started asking some situation based questions where he was giving me different scenarios
and I had to provide the solution for the same. Then the third and the last round was HR
round.

##  Preparation Resources
 Preparing for product interviews
 Cracking the pm interviews
 Decode and conquer
 Pm school exercises playlist

 Pm exercises (for pm cases)
 Prepleaf (aptitude)
 Gfg(puzzles)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Main thing for PM, consulting or any managerial role is case preparation.While preparing for
cases (product or consulting) never just read the solution of the case.
Try to set up the interview environment and ask your friend to give you a case . Set the
timer(initially it’ll be hard to complete it on time) and try to solve that within the set time. After
you are done with your case , read the solution and write the things which you missed out
which could have made your solution better. And also you should first focus on the structure
by which you’ll be solving the case that will help you in not diverting from the problem and
you’ll reach the solution easily.
