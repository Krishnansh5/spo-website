Shikhar Saroj Verma, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT-MS student in ECO will be joining Flipkart as AM (Business Development). Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Capital One [Business Analyst], Nomura [Analyst], JPMC [Focused Analytics], American
Express [Analyst], Barclays, Accenture Japan, Indus Insights

## Insights on the Selection Process
[1] There was resume shortlisting, not sure about the criteria. Probably a run-down of the
resume.
[2] No GD
[3] One hour test covering basic Aptitude and simple puzzles. One section of some basic
economics related questions was also there [supply-demand, game theory (ECO101 level)]

##  Preparation Resources
APTITUDE &amp; PUZZLES: Brainstellar, GFG puzzles, TedEd puzzles, CAT papers,
STATS AND ML: ‘StatQuest with Josh Starmer’ YouTube channel, MSO201 class notes, 50
challenging problems in probability, CS771 class notes
FINANCE: Investopedia, any standard textbook on financial engineering (JUST BASICS)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Please pick a few resources and stick to them. Do not worry about resource X being
marginally better than resource Y. I wasted too much time worrying about what book/resource
to follow. It is all the same. Just make sure you run through whatever source you follow by the
time the interviews start. Holds true for all profiles.
It is a great idea to be a part of a small group (~4) of people who are preparing for the same
profile as you. Really helps in tracking progress. I did not do this and clearly suffered.
Please enroll in some MCQ test series to get a taste of the actual setting. The questions are
mostly easy but getting a lot of them right needs practice.
Surround yourself with supportive people when the interviews start. Let them handle phone
calls and interview call-ups. You can and should focus on running through your resume-
related answers and other such things.
Don’t get scared about chatter like company X not coming for placements, company Y only
doing binary hiring…none of it matters by the time placements start. There are more than
enough opportunities for you and your friends. Don’t become a part of the noise and calm
yourself and your friends down. SPO works very hard to improve # of companies every year.
They will take care of the companies coming in.
