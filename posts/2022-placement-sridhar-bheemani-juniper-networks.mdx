Sridhar Bheemani, studying in IIT Kanpur as a MT student in EE(SPCOM) will be joining Juniper Networks as ASIC Design Engineer 2. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Intel for Digital Design Engineer, Cisco for ASIC Design Engineer
profile, Analog Devices for Digital Design Engineer role, TSMC for Physical Design role and
Aura for Analog Design Engineer profile

## Insights on the Selection Process
Except TSMC every other company has a selection process based on written test. TSMC was

##  Preparation Resources
Digi.QS pdf
2. Digital IC design lectures from IIT madras by Janakiraman.
3. VLSI expert website for STA.
4. Hardware modelling using Verilog from IIT KGP by Indranil Sen Gupta (Highly
recommended).
5. Digital Circuit design (Gate notes are very much enough).
6. Memories (SRAM, DRAM V.IMP topic) from rabaey lectures.
7. C programming - You just need to practice the MCQs from geeksforgeeks(GFG), but

obviously it is better if know how to code also.
8. FIFO depth, Synchronizers, Clock Domain Crossing, Computer Architecture (mainly
for written tests V.IMP topic), Physical design flow and Puzzles from GFG.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
When it comes to written tests be prepared with Aptitude, C programming, Digi.QS pdf.
Prepare consistently and it will be like mini preparation for the GATE exam. Be calm and show
your skills and honesty from your side. Try to answer each question that the interviewer asks,
try to avoid saying don’t know, they will give you enough time to solve and explain the steps
that you are following. They see your approach to the question, don’t mind about result
sometimes.
