## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do not leave any part during your preparation. Even a small question unanswered in any topic
can make your impressions look bad. For case studies do not give up at any cost. Answer the
question in the most logical way. If you can study both analog and digital and prepare for both
domains as they go parallelly. That will increase the insight in both domains. Understand
everything physically as the answer with physical explanations are highly valued in the
interviews.
