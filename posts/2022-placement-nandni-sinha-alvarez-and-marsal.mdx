## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Don't prepare just for consulting, have one or more profiles as a backup option.
Practice as many case study/guesstimate questions as possible (with seniors and friends)
Commonly asked Case Studies: Market entry, cost optimisation, and profitability.
Start your preparation at least from July.
Be smiling and confident in interviews and workshops as well, and be communicative.
