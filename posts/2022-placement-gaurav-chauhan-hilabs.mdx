Gaurav Chauhan, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in AE  will be joining Hilabs as Data Scientist. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
- Wells Fargo (Program Associate)
- Barclays (Associate Data Scientist)
- Walmart (Data Analyst)
- Navi (DS)
- Navi (Analytics)

## Insights on the Selection Process
- There was a single-round test consisting of Machine learning, Prob and stats, and aptitude MCQ.
- The interview consisted of 3 rounds, and each took around 1 hour.
- In the first round, they mostly asked theoretical kind of questions from machine learning. Then moved to the resume and asked to explain the projects, questioning the highlighted
terminologies in detail. In the end, they also asked 3 medium-level puzzles (I answered only 2 of them)
- The second round was the coding round. 2 medium-level DSA questions, one was based on the use of the hash table, other was a simple graph question. 2 SQL questions ( I answered just one of them).
- In the third round, there was not any particular question, it was mostly a discussion. They gave some conditions on Xgboost vs Random forest and then sequentially followed the
discussion by giving various cases.

##  Preparation Resources
- Leetcode and GFG for coding and other concepts of DSA.
- SQLZOO for practising SQL.
- GFG and Brainstellar for puzzles.
- There weren’t any particular resources for ML. various articles, club projects, GitHub
links, and Andrew Ng Coursera courses. I find the lecture notes of the data mining course quite
useful.
- Probabilitycourse.com for prob and stats.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
- Even though you are opting for the data-based role, practice coding regularly.
- In almost every data-based role they will ask SQL in tests and interviews, and it doesn’t
take a lot of time to get decent knowledge of SQL, so don’t skip it.
- Whatever you do, be consistent. Rather than preparing a lot for some days and skipping on others, be consistent and prepare a decent amount regularly.
- Make a good resume and intro, and be ready to explain every point written on it.
- Make a proper plan for the preparation and stick to it religiously. Randomly wandering on different things will not help you much.
