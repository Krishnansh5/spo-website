Anubhav Kalyani, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will be joining Sprinklr as Product Engineer. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
- Glean (Software Engineer)
- Graviton (Software and Quant)
- Cohesity (Software Engineer)
- Google (Software Engineer)
- Quantbox(Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
- Online Assessment (Quite Tough) but selection through CSE Branch and those who had performed quite well in the assessment
- Round 1- Coding question found on GfG which was done through DP or 2 Pointers
- Round 2- Coding Question Based on Trees and Graphs
- Round 3- Design a Library System (Done through SQL/Databases)
- Round 4- In general another design question but due to lack of time Behavioral round was
conducted.
- Round 5 – HR Round

##  Preparation Resources
- LeetCode (solve many hard and some medium-level problems since they are of the
same type as asked in interviews and online assessments, Some hard problems of DP
like cherry pickup can be done only if solved before on LeetCode or elsewhere.)
- Codeforces (use for speed and building confidence for online assessments and
improving the habit of thinking on the spot)
- Test from Pclub Archives as many hard problems are repeated from there.
- For Quant - Brainstellar and 50 challenging puzzles of probability (Solve many times
completely)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
- You need to keep your friends in constant touch with the SPO team so that there is quick info transfer.
- Solve all the popular hard problems of DP from Leetcode.
- Since the Placement interviews are one after the other be ready for waking up at odd times or the whole night.
- Give contests from Leetcode and Codeforces.  Don’t leave things for the last and start early.
- Form a group for discussing coding problems among your friends.
- For HFTs start preparing CSE core subjects like Operating Systems and networks and Architecture from the beginning as mostly the entire interview revolves around it.
