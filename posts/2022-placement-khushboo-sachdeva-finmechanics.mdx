## Insights on the Selection Process
It was quite wholesome, I was tested on three angles : Maths, Finance & Coding. There were
2 rounds of interviews. First one was purely technical, 2 people in panel - One was the
founder and other was Associate Consultant. I was asked a Brainstellar puzzle, some
questions on python (my preferred language) and finance questions related to projects on my
resume which mainly included Accounting & options. Besides that, they also asked about
what the company does and surprisingly no candidate was able to answer this question fully. I
attended the pre placement talk and hence was able to answer, the interviewers were quite
happy (minor thing but got bonus points). Second round was more of an HR round where my
panel consisted of 8 people expecting you to get intimidated. They mainly talked about some
questions based on my resume, making situations out of it. Also, I was questioned about my
adaptability if I had to code since I was more interested in Finance & Consulting. They also
make you fill an HR form with the test, on which you can be questioned in the interview.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Try not to panic in any situation - it's 70-80% about how confident you are and the way
you conduct yourself, rest depends on your technical soundness.
● You can never prepare with 100% resources, just select what you find useful and
complete that resource. Stick to limited resources and do them honestly.
● Being a non-coder, it doesn't harm revisiting the basics and practicing problems before
placements, it helped me a lot. Do not completely ignore coding, it will always help!
● Try to apply to maximum companies that come, interview experiences are valuable
and will make you ready for the D-Day.
