Lakshay Rastogi, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT (DM) student in CSE & BSBE will be joining Bain and Company as Associate Consultant. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Glean – Software
Mckinsey – Bussiness Analyst

## Insights on the Selection Process
Consulting interview process revolves a lot around how well you are able to solve a case.
Don;t need to solve it explicitly, rather the process is what matters. Along with this
communication is absolute key. If you are not able to explain your thinking to the interviewer
right now, or answer his/her question properly, how will you do this in front of a client.

##  Preparation Resources
For case interviews, I used Case Interviews Cracked, SRCC Case Compedium and IIMA
CaseBook. Majorly 4 types of cases you need to practise well. Guesstimates are equally
important.
Make good answers for the questions usually asked.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
First and foremost : Decide what role you would want to explore for the next 2-3 years of your
life. Don’t thing about this decision as life changing. You are just 22. Even if you go for
something you feel you like right now, but don’t actually later, there will be inumerable
opportunities to move into something you find more intereting.
Currently I feel consulting will be a very nice learning curve for me, but I am not taking it as a
line of truth, that I am going to build my entire 30 year career out of this. Once you work at
your recent job, you will realize what work you would like more.
Second : Don’t ever get anxious by how sorted somebody else looks. Primarily for two
reasons : If they are genuinely then it’s great, but you aren’t and that’s completely fine;
Second, most aren’t they just present themselves as such to not showcase confusion.
Later Do’s : Start early. Don’t try to fool yourself. Prepare honestly. It will take a lot of time,
good feedback, hardwork, focus to get better at things. Don’t look at people who are already
good at the things you are trying to get good at. They have put in a lot of effort which you just
can’t see.
Do’s : Always make a group to prepare and keep motivating each other. Preparing alone is
very difficult, although not impossible.
Do’s : Never ever hesitate to reach out for help.
Dont’s : Think of anything : “Ki ho jayega”. You don’t what you’re taking so lightly right now,
will be so crucial in landing your preferred job.
Dont’s : Let go of your academics for preparing. It will just add to the pressure. It also acts as
a different area for you to focus on, and can help in breaking the monotony.
