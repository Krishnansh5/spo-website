## Insights on the Selection Process

-Panelists were Seniors/Partners of the company.
-HR questions like COVID pandemic experience, accomplishments in college, gaps on
resume, poor performance if any etc.
-Questions were majorly based on resume.
-Guesstimates and case study on topics related to resume, in my case, but from general
overview, it varied.

##  Preparation Resources
IIT Bombay Case book
IITB Videos on youtube
SRCC Case book
IIT Ahmedabad Framework of cases.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Dos:

-Start building your profile and peaks early; genuine over-the-years development >> last-
minute self projects

-Familiarize yourself with frameworks of different types of cases; Practice on a shuffled basis.
-As you practice cases, customize the frameworks to add your mistakes/missing perspectives.
-Process and logic are more important than your final answers in guesstimates. So
concentrate on your logic more than the answers.
-Resume headers are important. Quantification is imperative. How you label your
achievements and projects is vital.
-Believe in yourself. Introduce yourself as if you have undergone a very exciting and insightful
journey, and its your chance to present yourself.
Don’ts:
-Don’t focus on extremely diverse profiles. Being selective from the start saves time and effort.
-Don’t write over-exaggerated stuff on your resume; Write only the points you can defend.
(Moderate resume + good defense >> Good resume + Poor defense)
-Don’t use repetitive and filler words during interviews. Take time to think MECE structure
while cases. Taking time >> Irrelevant facts
-Don’t overtire yourself in the last few days, solving cases require a fresh mind.
