M Shiva Teja Reddy, studying in IIT Kanpur as a MT  student in AE  will be joining Airbus  as Associate Flight Controls and Hydraulics Engineer. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
NONE

## Insights on the Selection Process
Technical Interview: Questions based on the projects that you have done. Course projects,
Btech projects, Mtech thesis.
HR interview: To test your communication and presence of mind.

##  Preparation Resources
Youtube, Google, Father.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Dos: Always ask time for any question that you are asked in case you need it. Ask for a
minute and think about what you want to say.
Use hand gestures. The interviewers sometimes try to set a friendly atmosphere so play along
it helps ease your nerves.

Dont’s: If you want to get selected in that company then don’t tell them about your other
preferences that you are attending interviews for. They may ask if you are trying for other
companies. Say yes but that the one you are attending right now is your highest priority. Even
if it’s a lie.
