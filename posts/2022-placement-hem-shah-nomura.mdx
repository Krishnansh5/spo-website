## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do's
Prioritize the profiles that you choose to apply. Also keep options open in the same industry like SDE and Data Science 
Before sitting in any profiles for placements, it is advisable to do an internship irrespective of profiles being the same as an internship depicts that a person is able to work in a corporate setting.
Get you resume reviewed by as many people as possible. It is helpful to take ideas from different seniors/current employees regarding highlighting what the interviewer might be looking for as well as removing errors.
Highly advisable to perform pair programming for SDE prep and case solving with other aspirants for consulting jobs.
Don’ts
Don’t aim for profiles in different industries like Tech as well as Consulting. Even I made my choice to go for Tech/Quant like 2 months before the interviews which highly affected my preparation 
Don’t work based on someone else’s placement goal, chart your own path to avoid distractions from diverting to the resources that others follow.
