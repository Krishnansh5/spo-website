## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Maintain a regular practice schedule for coding tasks because it will come in handy during
interviews. Practice frequently asked interview questions in particular.
In addition to typical IDEs, try using Notepad to create your code because you often forget
details like indentations and syntax due to autocomplete ness of IDEs.
Think carefully and courteously before you speak.
Rather than giving an interview, feel more like having a friendly discussion with the
interviewer.
