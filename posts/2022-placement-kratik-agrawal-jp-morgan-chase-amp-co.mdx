## Insights on the Selection Process
The interview process consisted of 3 Rounds, with 2 Technical Interviews and 1 HR Interview:
All of the interview rounds began with exchanging introductions.
Technical Interviews:
1. First Round: 1 st round was based on solving DSA problems. The interviewer asked for
favorite data structures. Then the interviewer focused on the responded data
structures and grilled on them going from easy question to medium questions.
2. Second Round: This round was based on System Design concepts and OOPS. The
interview revolved around devising a system design for a Vending Machine.
HR Interview:
This interview revolved around standard HR questions. It was more of a structured
conversation and culture fitment round.
Each of the rounds lasted for 30 minutes for me. Also, some people had an additional
Technical Interview round between First and Second rounds, which was based on solving CP
type coding problems.

 Striver’s A-Z &amp; SDE Sheet: https://takeuforward.org/
This is handy if you’re a bit clueless about your preparation and need some structures
approach for preparing yourself.
 Puzzles from Brainstellar (https://brainstellar.com/)

holistic view of coding interview scenarios.
 “A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews” by Xinfeng Zhou. – Great

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
 Have a Peer group: The placement season tends to be overwhelming at times. Be
sure to talk to your peer group. It helps to discuss things during preparation and after
tests. Also, a close friend acts as a wonderful support system.
 Have a go-to senior: Placement season imposes a lot of confusions, like, which
profiles to target, which companies to apply for, whether to accept or reject your PPO
offer, etc. Besides all of this, you need someone to cheer you up and give valuable last
minute advices when you’re hours away from your interview.
 Understand &amp; Accept your chances: Be sure to realise your potential and not shy off
from applying to job opportunities. Also, it is always recommended to have a few
backup options, which you’re confident to crack incase you run out of luck.
 Build a Self-Story: For getting through culture fitment and HR questions, you just don’t
need a good resume, but a great binding agent to your resume. Have an
understanding of how your resume reflects your story and mold it appropriately
according to the role and company.
 Know your recruiter: Thoroughly read the Job Description provided by the company.
Read the ‘About Us’ page of the firm. Have a thorough understanding of what are the
values that your potential employer considers worthy. Fins ways to sneak in these bits
of information in your conversation with the interviewers to reflect your interest in the
company and profile.
 Target Wisely: Discuss the profiles and companies that you’re targeting with your
seniors and get a fair understanding of how the firm typically recruits and what do they
look for in the resume, tests and interviews.
 Hear your Interviewer: Hear what the interview speaks of themselves in the interview.
This helps greatly in asking out questions at the end of the interview and also while
formulating your answers during the interview.
